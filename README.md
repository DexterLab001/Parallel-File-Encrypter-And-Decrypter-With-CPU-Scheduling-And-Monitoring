# Parallel-File-Encrypter-Decrypter
The Parallel File Encrypter and Decrypter is a high-performance system designed to secure and recover files using parallel computing techniques. The project leverages both CPU and GPU parallelism to accelerate the process of file encryption and decryption, making it significantly faster compared to traditional sequential approaches.
